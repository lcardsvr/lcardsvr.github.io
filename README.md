# Belly-button-challenge
Module 14 Challenge

In this assignment an interactive dashboard was built to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset, which catalogues the microbes that colonise human navels.

## Instructions
The work is divided into the following subsections:

1. Using the D3 library to read in samples.json from the URL https://2u-data-curriculum-team.s3.amazonaws.com/dataviz-classroom/v1.1/14-Interactive-Web-Visualizations/02-Homework/samples.json.
2. Creating a horizontal bar chart with a dropdown menu to display the top 10 OTUs found in that individual.
3. Creating a bubble chart that displays each sample.
4. Displaying the sample metadata, i.e., an individual's demographic information.
5. Updating all the plots when a new sample is selected.
6. Deploying the app to GitHub. 
7. Created a gauge chart which dispays the Belly Button Washing frequency.

## Bar Chart

The bar chart was created by taking a slice and reversing the data that matches a Test Subject ID number. The initial value is the first ID in the Array. The visualization matches the requirement. 

## Bubble Chart

The bubble chart was created by taking all the sample data that matches a Test Subject ID number. The initial value is the first ID in the Array. The visualization matches the requirement. 

## Metadata and Deployment

Metadata initialises without error. The Metadata updates when a new sample is selected. The App was successfully Deployed to Github Pages.
